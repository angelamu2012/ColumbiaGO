### App Description

Columbia GO is a scavenger hunt game based around Columbiaâ€™s campus that utilizes MapKit and ARKit. Using our app, players can collect trophies hidden in different parts of campus. 

Trophies might be hidden in Chef Mike's Sub Shop, on Law Bridge, or in many other secret locations. Students new to Columbia will be able to learn about all of the fun places on campus through an immersive AR/VR experience.

Users can create an account, start a quest, and collect trophies as they progress through the scavenger hunts. They can also compete with their friends and check their rank on our leaderboard.
